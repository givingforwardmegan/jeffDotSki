Howdy! I am a developer in the Dallas area. Over the past few months I have developed (subtle pun) a fondness for react/redux.
I decided it would be fun to build an opensource website. It has been a blast sipping coffee in the evenings while creating this
and doing some collaboration with my friends at work.

Feel free to look through this as examples! I'm not going to say I know everything, but I did manage to get the various frameworks working together!
