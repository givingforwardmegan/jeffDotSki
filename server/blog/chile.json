Afterall, it is the experience of leaving one’s home country and witnessing another culture that is the true reward."

      "text": "As someone who works in IT I have always had insecurities about not having my own website, particularly now that I claim to be a “web developer”. But I never created a website because I possessed no content that even I found to be interesting. Though I consider myself to be a bit of an artist, none of my hobbies have ever been immortalized into a digital form."

      "text": "So without further ado, two adventures behind (Japan and Cancun) but not a moment too late! It’s never too late to start loving, and never too late to forgive, and it’s never too late to make a travel blog!"
