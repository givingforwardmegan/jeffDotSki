      "text": "So I started collecting shot glasses! If you are a world traveler this is a great collectible. They are almost everywhere you go and they will be the cheapest thing in the gift shop. In my search for these glasses, I have gone into many shops that I would not have otherwise in search of a unique glass for the journey."
